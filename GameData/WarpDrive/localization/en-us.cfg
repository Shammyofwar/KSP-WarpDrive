		#WD_WarpDrive_title        = Alcubierre Drive (Light)
		#WD_WarpDrive_manufacturer = Zefram Kerman's Warp Supplies Co.
		#WD_WarpDrive_description  = This piece of technology is designed to sneakily evade the prohibition of faster than light travel described by the theory of relativity by translating a small subset of spacetime across space at unbelievable speeds while imparting no momentum change to the vessel at all. Since it was designed by Zefram Kerman, it may not function without the application of rock music.<br><br>There is a note, pinned to the inner surface of the engine:<br><i>EM decays! So you need "Containment Field" to accumulate and store it. To activate containment field you need current power production 100 EC/s. Once activated containment field consumes 100EC/s and generates 0.01 EM/s.</i>
